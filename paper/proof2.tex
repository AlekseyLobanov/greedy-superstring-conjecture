\subsection{Case Analysis}
\label{sec:proof2}
We denote the level of the vertex $ s $ as $ \lvl (s) $, and consider the three possible values of $\lvl(s)$.


\paragraph{Analysis of vertices of the level \texorpdfstring{$3$}{3}}

In this case $ s \in {\cal S} $, and vertex $ s $, is incident only to arcs $ (\pref (s) \to s)$ and $(s \to \suff (s)) $. The Collapse procedure leaves only one instance of each such arc. Hence, in the graph $ G'_{cl} $, $ C'_{cl} (s) = \{s \} $. This implies that (\ref{eqn:contradiction}) does not hold in this case.

\paragraph{Analysis of vertices of the level \texorpdfstring{$2$}{2}}

Let $ t \in C'_{cl} (s) $. Denote by $ \operatorname{dist} (t) $ the length of the shortest path from $ s $ to $ t $ in $ G'_{cl} $. We take a vertex with minimal $ \operatorname{dist} (t) $ among all vertices in the set $ C'_{cl} (s) \backslash V (s) $. Consider the path $ P = v_1 \to v_2 \to \ldots \to v_n $, which connects $ s $ and $ t $.

Note that if $ \lvl (u) = 1 $, then $ u \notin V (s) $. Therefore $ \lvl (v_i) \ge 2 $ holds for $ i<n $, otherwise there would be a vertex with smaller $ \operatorname {dist} $. Since $ | \lvl (r) - \lvl (u) | = 1 $ is fulfilled for any edge $ (r \to u) $, at the beginning of the path the levels of vertices alternate: $ \lvl (v_1) = 2 $, $ \lvl (v_2) = 3 $, $ \lvl (v_3) = 2 $, and so on (see the example in the figure \ref{fig:lvl2path6}).

\caption{Example of the path $P$ for $n=6$.}\label{fig:lvl2path6}
\end{figure}

We also note that if $ \lvl (v_{2k}) = 3 $, then the pair of edges $ v_{2k-1} \to v_{2k} \to v_{2k + 1} $ will be <<reflected>> by the collapse from $ v_{2k} $ to some vertex $ u_{2k} $. In addition, in the graph $ G_{cl} $, there are edges $ (u_0 \to v_1) $ and $ (v_1 \to u_2) $, where $ u_0 = \pref (s) $ and $ u_2 = \suff (s) $. We add to this that if there is a pair of edges $ (u_{2k} \to v_{2k + 1}) $ and $ (v_{2k + 1} \to u_{2k + 2}) $ in the graph, then there is a vertex $ u_{2k + 1} $, into which these edges can be reflected by another collapse.

In view of the fact that the edges $ (v_{2k-1} \to v_{2k}) $ and $ (v_{2k} \to v_{2k + 1}) $ are the only ones that are incident to the vertex $ v_{2k} \in S $, two instances of each of them existed in the graph from the very beginning. Moreover, since $ \lvl (s) = 2 $, all the vertices of the level $ 3 $ have already been examined, and therefore at least one collapse has been performed from each vertex $ v_ {2k} $ of the level $ 3 $. Thus, in the graph at some time there existed edges $ (v_{2k-1} \to u_{2k}) $ and $ (u_{2k} \to v_{2k + 1}) $ (see the example in the figure \ref {fig:lvl2pathuv}).

\end{figure}

Now we will exploit the fact that the pair of edges $ (u_0 \to v_1) $ and $ (v_1 \to u_2) $ has not been collapsed. This means that after this collapse weak connectivity would be broken.

Note that $ u_1 = \varepsilon $; in addition, after the collapse $ u_0 $ and $ u_2 $ would be weakly connected through $ \varepsilon $. This means, in particular, that after the collapse $ v_1 $ can't be connected with $ u_2 $, otherwise the mutual weak connectivity would not be violated for any of the pairs of vertices.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:pathcollapse}
For all $ k $ such that $ 3 \le 2k + 1 \le n $ at least one collapse was performed from the vertex $ v_{2k + 1} $.\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We will prove this by induction on $ k $. $ k = 0 $ will be the the induction base.

Suppose that at least one collapse is made from the vertex $ v_{2k '+ 1} $ for all $ k' $ such that $ 3 \le 2k '+ 1 <2k + 1 $. Suppose that not a single collapse was made from the vertex $ v_{2k + 1} $. This means that the edge $ (u_{2k} \to v_{2k + 1}) $ is present in the graph at the current iteration.

By definition, after a correct collapse from the vertex $ v_{2k '+ 1} $, a pair of edges $ (u_{2k'} \to u_{2k '+ 1}) $ and $ (u_{2k' + 1} \to u_{2k '+ 2}) $. Moreover, any of these edges can disappear from the graph only after the collapse from the vertex $ u_ {2k '+ 1} $. But the level of this vertex is $ 1 $, and therefore it has not yet been visited. Therefore, both edges remain in the graph at the current iteration.

Then there exists a weak path $ Q $ in the graph of the following form:

$$
Q = v_1 - v_2 - \ldots - v_{2k+1} - u_{2k} - u_{2k-1} - \ldots u_2.
$$

It means that $v_1$ and $u_2$ were weakly connected from the very beginning. Contradiction.
\end{proof}

From the lemma \ref{lem:pathcollapse} it follows that on the current iteration in the graph there must exist a weak path $ u_2 - \ldots - u_{2k} - u_{2k + 1} $ for any $ k $ such that $ 3 \le 2k + 1 \le n $.

Now we note that either $ \lvl (v_{n}) = 2 $, or $ \lvl (v_{n}) = 1 $. Let us consider both cases.

If $ \lvl (v_{n}) = 1 $, then, since from every vertex $ v_{2k + 1} $ there occurs at least one collapse, there exists a pair of edges $ u_{2k} \to u_{2k + 1} ) $ and $ (u_{2k + 1} \to v_n) $ in the graph. Hence, there exists a weak path of the form $ v_1 - v_2 - \ldots - v_n - u_{2k + 1} - \ldots - u_3 - u_2 $, and the vertices $ v_1 $ and $ u_2 $ turn out to be weakly connected. Contradiction (see the example in the figure \ref {fig:lvl2n6pathvu}).

If $ \lvl (v_{n}) = 2 $, then $ n = 2k + 1 $ for some $ k $. Hence, by the lemma \ref{lem:pathcollapse}, at least one collapse was made from the vertex $ v_{2k + 1} $. On the other hand, the vertex $ v_{2k + 1} \notin V (s) $, and hence it has not been examined yet. Contradiction (see the example in the figure \ref{fig:lvl2n5pathvu}).

\paragraph{Analysis of vertices of the level \texorpdfstring{$1$}{1}}

In this case, all the vertices at the levels $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ are already considered.

Note that the collapse from the vertex $ s $ can potentially violate only the connectivity of $ s $ and $ \varepsilon $. Therefore $ \varepsilon \notin C'_{cl} (s) $. Let's take an arbitrary vertex $ t $ from the statement \ref{eqn:contradiction}. From what has just been said, it follows that $ \lvl (t) = 1 $.

In view of the fact that $ t $ is connected with $ s $, the vertex $ t $ is incident to at least one edge. But it can not be connected with the vertex on the level $ 0 $, because only $ \varepsilon $ is located at this level, and $ \varepsilon \notin C'_{cl} (s) $. Hence, $ t $ is incident to at least one edge leading to the level $ 2 $. Moreover, since $ \bal (t) = 0 $, at least one such edge comes to $ t $, and at least one such edge leaves $ t $.

Starting from this point, we will call all vertices as strings which they correspond to. So, $ t $ corresponds to some string $ \tt b $ consisting of one symbol. We have just shown that there are edges $ ({\tt xb} \to {\tt b}) $ and $ ({\tt b} \to {\tt bc}) $ for some symbols $ {\tt x} $ and $ {\tt c} $.

First we prove several auxiliary lemmas.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:nobeps}
In the graph there neither was an edge $ ({\tt b} \to \varepsilon) $ nor an edge $ (\varepsilon \to {\tt b}) $.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let at least one of such edges appear in the graph at some iteration. According to the algorithm, such an edge can disappear from the graph only after the collapse in the vertex $ {\tt b} $. Since this vertex has not yet been examined, such an edge is present in the graph at this moment. But this means that $ \varepsilon \in C'_{cl} (s) $. Contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:bccsave}
Each edge of the form \sedge{bc}{c}, \sedge{b}{bc}, or \sedge{ab}{b} that ever appeared in the graph was not collapsed until the current iteration.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Each edge of the form \sedge{bc}{c} can only be collapsed with the edge \sedge{b}{bc}. Then, if a collapse actually occurs from the vertex $ {\tt bc} $, it leads to the appearance of the edge $ ({\tt b} \to \varepsilon) $. But according to the lemma \ref{lem:nobeps}, there never were any such edges in the graph. Contradiction.

The proofs for \sedge{b}{bc} and \sedge{ab}{b} are the same.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:bbcone}
At the current iteration, there is exactly one instance of the edge \sedge{b}{bc}.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let there be at least two such edges. Then at least two different edges must come from $ {\tt bc} $.

Suppose that there exists at least one edge \sedge{bc}{c}. But then, if we make a collapse from the vertex $ {\tt bc} $, the vertices $ {\tt b} $, $ {\tt c} $ and $ {\tt bc} $ still remain weakly connected by edges \sedge{b}{bc}, $ ({\tt b} \to \varepsilon) $ and $ (\varepsilon \to {\tt c}) $. Hence, this collapse is correct (see figure \ref{fig:lvl1lemmabcc}). But then the collapsing algorithm during examination of the vertex $ {\tt bc} $, should have made at least one more collapse. It contradicts the fact that it does the maximum possible number of correct collapses.

\caption{Correctness of the collapse in case when the edge \sedge{bc}{c} is present.}\label{fig:lvl1lemmabcc}

Hence, there is at least one edge \sedge{bc}{bcd}. Then $ {\tt bcd} \in {\cal S} $, and then initially there were two pairs of edges \sedge{bc}{bcd} and \sedge{bcd}{cd} in the graph. So, from {\tt bcd}, at least one collapse was made, and it led to the appearance of the edge \sedge{bc}{c}. But at the current iteration the edge \sedge{bc}{c} can't exist, so it was also collapsed. It's a contradiction with the lemma \ref{lem:bccsave}.

\caption{The scheme of proof of the lemma \ref{lem:bbcone}.}\label{fig:lvl1lemmabbcone}
\end{figure}

So, there is only one edge \sedge{b}{bc}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:bcup}
The vertex $ {\tt bc} $ is weakly connected with at least one vertex at the level $ 3 $.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let it not be so. Then $ {\tt bc} $ can contain only edges \sedge{b}{bc}, and only edges \sedge{bc}{c} can come from it. By the lemma \ref{lem:bbcone}, there is only one instance of the edge \sedge{b}{bc}. Hence, there is exactly one instance of the edge \sedge{bc}{c}. But then the algorithm had to collapse this pair of edges when examining $ {\tt bc} $, because this operation would only separate $ {\tt bc} $ from all other vertices without violating the connectivity of $ \varepsilon $ and $ {\cal S} $. Contradiction.
\end{proof}

By lemma \ref{lem:bcup} either there exists $ {\tt d} $ such that there is an edge \sedge{bc}{bcd}, or there is a symbol $ {\tt a} $ such that there is an edge \sedge{abc}{bc}. Suppose there is no such $ {\tt a} $, which means that there exists some $ {\tt d} $.

Then $ {\tt bcd} \in {\cal S} $, and therefore initially there were two instances of edges \sedge{bc}{bcd} and \sedge{bcd}{cd} in the graph. So, at least one collapse was made from {\tt bcd}, and it led to the appearance of the edge \sedge{bc}{c}. The edge \sedge{bc}{c} could not be collapsed by the lemma \ref{lem:bccsave}. Hence, some other edge must come to $ {\tt bc} $, and by lemma \ref{lem:bbcone} it can not be another instance of \sedge{b}{bc}.

Hence, there is an $ {\tt a} $ such that there is an edge \sedge{abc}{bc}. Then $ {\tt abc} \in {\cal S} $, and from $ {\tt abc} $ exactly one collapse was made, which led to the appearance of two edges \sedge{ab}{b} and \sedge{b}{bc}, which were not collapsed at the current moment by the lemma \ref{lem:bccsave}.

Therefore, $ {\tt bc} $ contains at least two edges: \sedge{abc}{bc} and \sedge{b}{bc}. Hence, at least two edges come from $ {\tt bc} $.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:bccexist}
At the current iteration, there is at least one edge \sedge{bc}{c}.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let it not be so. Then, since at least one edge must come from $ {\tt bc} $, it is an edge of the form \sedge{bc}{bcd}. So, $ {\tt bcd} \in {\cal S} $, initially there were two instances of edges \sedge{bc}{bcd} and \sedge{bcd}{cd} in the graph, and there was made at least one collapse from {\tt bcd}, which led to the appearance of the edge \sedge{bc}{c}. Contradiction.
\end{proof}

So, by the lemma \ref{lem:bbcone}, there is one edge \sedge{b}{bc} in the graph, and by the \ref{lem:bccexist} lemma there is at least one edge \sedge{bc}{c}.

But we assert that this pair of edges should have been collapsed, which will contradict the lemma \ref{lem:bccsave} and the definition of the algorithm which makes the maximum possible number of collapses.

The point is that even after the collapse there will be weak paths $ {\tt b} - \varepsilon - {\tt c} $ and $ {\tt b} - {\tt ab} - {\tt abc} - {\tt bc} $, and hence the connectivity of the vertices $ {\tt b} $, $ {\tt c} $ and $ {\tt bc} $ will be preserved after the collapse (see figure \ref{fig:lvl1final}).

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\caption{The final state of the graph.}\label{fig:lvl1final}
\end{figure}

In this case, one more correct collapse can be made from $ {\tt bc} $. Contradiction.

This completes the proof of the theorem for the $3$-SCS instance.
