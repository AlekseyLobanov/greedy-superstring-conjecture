\subsection{Equivalence of Collapsing and Greedy Hierarchical Conjectures}
\subsection{Greedy Implies Greedy Hierarchical}

\begin{theorem}
The Greedy Conjecture implies the Weak Greedy Hierarchical Conjecture: if the Greedy Algorithm is 2-approximate, then so is the Greedy Hierarchical Algorithm.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Consider a~permutation of the input strings. We say that it is a~{\em valid greedy permutation} if it can be constructed by the Greedy Algorithm: there is a~way of $n-1$ merges of $n$~input strings that leads to this permutation such that at every step the two merged strings have the largest overlap. To prove the theorem, we show that the permutation constructed by the Greedy Hierarchical Algorithm is a~valid greedy permutation.

Assume that $\pi=(s_1, \dots, s_n)$ is a~permutation constructed by GHA. Consider the following algorithm~$A$: it starts with a~sequence $(s_1, \dots, s_n)$ and on every step merges two neighbor strings in the sequence that have the largest overlap. It is a~greedy algorithm, but instead of considering all pairwise overlaps, it only considers overlap of neighbor strings in the sequence. Of course, in the end, this algorithm constructs exactly the permutation~$\pi$. To show that $\pi$ is a~valid greedy permutation, we show that at every iteration of~$A$ no two strings have longer overlap than the two strings merged by~$A$.

Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that at some iteration $A$~merges some two neighbor strings with overlap of length~$k$ whereas there are non-neighbor strings~$p$ and~$q$ with $v=\overlap(p,q)$, $|v|>k$. 
%Further assume that this is the earliest such iteration. 
At this point $p$~is a~merge of input strings $s_a, s_{a+1}, \dotsc, s_b$
and $q$~is a~merge of input strings $s_c, s_{c+1}, \dotsc, s_d$. 
Then, $v=\overlap(p,q)=\overlap(s_b,s_c)$. Since the algorithm~$A$
merges neighbor strings in order of decreasing overlap length, $p$~is merged with a~string~$q'$ such that $|\overlap(p,q')| \le k$ and $q$~is merged with a~string~$p'$ such that $|\overlap(p',q)| \le k$. This, in turn, means that the Eulerian solution around input strings~$s_b$ and~$s_c$ in GHA looks as shown in~Figure~\ref{fig:gagha}(a). Hence, $v$~is a~node with at least one incoming arc from the previous level and at least one outgoing arc to the previous level. Such a~pair of edges in the Eulerian solution constructed by GHA may only occur when~$v$ is the last chance of
its connected component to connect to the rest of the solution (see line~\ref{alg:last} of Algorithm~\ref{algo:gha}). This, in turn, means that right before the pair of arcs $(\pref(v), v)$ and $(v, \suff(v))$ were added to the Eulerian solution, there was an~Eulerian component where $v$~was the lexicographically largest among all shortest nodes. This component is shown schematically in~Figure~\ref{fig:gagha}(b). All overlap-nodes of this component lie on levels~$>k$. This means that all pairs of corresponding neighbor input strings are already merged at this stage. But then, $s_b$ and
$s_c$ already stay in the same merged string. This is a~contradiction with the assumption that the strings~$p$ and~$q$ are available for merging.
